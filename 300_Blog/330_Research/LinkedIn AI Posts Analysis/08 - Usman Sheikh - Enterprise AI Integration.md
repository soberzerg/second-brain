## Текст поста

The Enterprise AI war is not about intelligence.

It's about integration.

"First agent to connect to all of your work apps—so it can access information and complete tasks across all of them—will probably win." David Sack

Many are underestimating how quickly we get there.

Today's landscape is fragmented:
→ 400+ hours/year lost to context switching
→ Knowledge trapped in dozens of siloed systems
→ Data "hot" for days, rarely accessed again
→ Valuable insights buried in unused documents

The agent that solves integration unlocks:
→ Information flowing effortlessly across systems
→ Automated workflows (legal, marketing, procurement)
→ Persistent context, independent of apps
→ A single, seamless interface replacing dozens of UIs

Current roadblocks for agents:
→ Messy data, not integration-ready
→ Cross-system authentication hurdles
→ Security policies blocking access
→ Difficulty maintaining cross-app context

What we can possibly do in the near future:
→ Inbox managed entirely by personalized AI assistant
→ Proactive alerts predicting issues before they arise
→ Proposals instantly tailored from previous interactions
→ Self-updating documentation as processes evolve

AI capabilities are exponentially growing:
→ AI model capabilities double every 7 months
→ 2019: seconds of task-handling capacity
→ Today: hour-long tasks handled in minutes
→ 2026: day-long tasks executed in hours
→ 2030: month-long projects completed in days

This isn't just about connecting apps.

Just like cloud transformed digital infrastructure, AI agents will redefine organizational intelligence.

Companies that master integration won't just become more efficient, they'll set a completely new baseline.

This will make traditional workflows look as obsolete as fax machines and filing cabinets.
