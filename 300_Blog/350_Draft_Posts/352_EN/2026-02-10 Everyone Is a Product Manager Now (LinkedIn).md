# Everyone Is a Product Manager Now

_February 10, 2026_

Boris Cherny — the creator of Claude Code — ships 5 pull requests a day. He built 20 prototypes in 2 days. 90% of the code was written by Claude Code itself.

No product manager. No designer. No QA. No team of five engineers.

This isn't a startup fairy tale. This is a real workflow inside Anthropic right now.

The old team model is broken.

You know the one: 1 PM writes specs, 1 designer creates mockups, 5 engineers build, 1 QA tests.

The problem? Code is no longer the bottleneck.

An engineer with AI tools works 3-5x faster. Five engineers now deliver what fifteen used to. But the PM still ships one feature spec per week.

Production capacity grew by an order of magnitude. Thinking capacity stayed the same.

So where's the bottleneck now?

Not in the code. In the head.

Defining the right problem. Understanding users. Deciding what to build — and what not to. Evaluating results. Everything that used to be "the PM's job."

But if an engineer can build a prototype in one evening and validate a hypothesis — why wait for someone to write a ticket?

Boris Cherny didn't wait. He built 20 prototypes in 2 days. He decided what to build. He built it. He tested it on himself.

The split between "thinkers" and "doers" is obsolete.

It made sense before. Code was expensive. Engineering hours were scarce. You needed someone to decide how to spend them.

Now code is cheap. A prototype takes an evening. An iteration takes an hour. What's expensive now: understanding the problem, market intuition, speed of decision-making.

The new value of an engineer isn't "I can write code." It's "I can figure out what to build and validate it in a day."

I'm already seeing this in my own work. At AGIents.pro — my solo project — I formulate hypotheses, build prototypes, and test with clients myself. Not because I can't hire a team. Because intermediaries slow things down.

At Clario — a team of 6 — roles are blurring. Engineers increasingly propose features themselves because they see the data, understand the context, and can validate an idea within a day.

This doesn't mean fire your PMs. It means changing the model. PMs become strategists — setting direction, not writing tickets. Engineers take ownership of tactics: formulate, build, validate.

A team of 3 with this model outperforms a team of 8 with the old one.

Development became a commodity. Thinking didn't.

Who generates feature ideas in your team — the PM or the engineers?
