# My AI assistant just passed its first real test

_12 February 2026_

---

My AI assistant built on Claude Code just had its baptism by fire.

Here's what happened. I was out skiing. A client pinged me about a bot I gave them for testing (still unfinished). After my changes the night before, text responses broke completely.

From the ski slope, I texted my Telegram assistant: "fix the text response bug in the bot."

It found the issue, fixed the code, deployed.

I checked the bot. First message (before the fix) got no reply. Second message went through perfectly. Bug squashed.

Texted the client back: "Fixed, try again."

The whole thing took minutes. From a ski slope. On my phone.

People kept asking me why I even built this Telegram-to-Claude-Code bridge. This is why.

Not for chatting with AI. For having a developer on call 24/7 that knows your entire codebase, has access to your servers, and doesn't care that you're on a mountain.
