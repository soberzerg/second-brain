# How I defined my positioning in 20 minutes

Yesterday I sat down to define my positioning.

You know the drill. Someone asks "what do you do?" and you freeze. You stare at the ceiling trying to squeeze out something better than "I help businesses implement AI."

It usually takes a week with a marketing consultant. And $1,000+.

Mine took 20 minutes.

I opened my "second brain." A system where all my projects, clients, case studies, and decisions are documented. Loaded a positioning prompt. And...

The AI already knew my context.

It didn't ask "tell me about your experience from scratch." It could see 20 years in software development. Around 100 IT projects. My current clients, active projects, and specific competencies.

So instead of generic warm-up questions, it went straight to the point:

"You wrote that you help implement AI. Let's get specific. What situations do clients come to you with?"

"What do clients thank you for? Not 'great work.' Specifically."

"What do you do during an audit that others DON'T?"

20 minutes later I had a complete document:

→ Positioning in 3 variations
→ Client portrait based on situations, not "men aged 30-50"
→ 5 core problems I solve
→ My "secret sauce" (things I thought were obvious)
→ 3 ready-made offers in one sentence each
→ 12 key talking points for content

Why did this work?

Not because AI is smart. Because it had context.

My projects. My clients. My case studies with real numbers. Decisions I've made. All of this was already in my knowledge base.

AI didn't invent anything. It extracted and structured what was already there.

Without context, it would have produced generic fluff like "you are an expert who helps clients achieve their goals." With context, it gave me precise language using my own words and my own cases.

This is the difference between "I played with ChatGPT" and "AI works for my business."

The first is typing a prompt and getting a generic answer.

The second is a system where AI knows your business from the inside.

And the second doesn't start with buying expensive tools. It starts with one simple step: digitizing what's already in your head.

What would you "unpack" first if AI already knew everything about your business?
