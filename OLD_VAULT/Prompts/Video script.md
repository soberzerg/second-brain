## News jacking

```
Act as a scriptwriter. 

Prepare a [15 second] video script that follows this structure. 

Compelling hook to capture attention
Outline of the issue

The video will consist of a talking head (me) and a background showing an article or similar news source. 

No image / overlays are needed. Only the text script.

The source is as follows:

## **Repurpose from long form**
[Source](https://aspiring-foundation-693.notion.site/Create-Video-Content-with-AI-Prompt-Playbook-6bd8a82ec52b44bdb8d6adbdc6df6c8a)

The first source of video content should be our long form written content.

Specifically:

- newsletters
- blog articles
- X threads
- X long form posts
- LinkedIn articles
- etc.

Any longer form piece of content where you go into detail and show your expertise.

For me my primary written content is, perhaps unsurprisingly, this newsletter. It’s the source for everything else I produce online.

Think about all the longer form content you produce and test some of it with this repurposing prompt:

```
Act as a expert content marketer script writer

Convert this written long form piece into a video outline

Do not include inserts, only text script

[copy/paste long form content]
```

For this example I used a piece about using common enemies in content marketing.

## Prompt Output

This output is a video outline.

Go through this and make changes to make sure your main point is covered.

Notice that this is _not_ a line by line script. This is on purpose.

Reading from a script is quite dull for the viewer. Instead I highly recommend using a series of talking points like this.

We’ll cover the exact mechanism in the next Part but in short we’ll look at each line here, deliver naturally based on that, stop, read the next line, deliver the content naturally again and repeat this for the whole script.

The recording will obviously have a _lot_ of us checking the script and not talking! But thanks to AI tools we can cut all of that out in seconds. The end result will be just us delivering the content.

For this reason a structured outline like this is perfect for delivery. You aren’t trying to remember any lines. You aren’t reading off an autocue. You are just reading a reminder then delivering in your own words.

However, I understand some people will still want a full script. That’s fine too! Let’s do that next.

## Line by line script

An alternative script format is a line by line script.

The process of recording will be similar. Record a line, read next line, record a line, read next one etc. And then using AI to autocut out all the reading and leave only the spoken parts.

But this method we work with a line by line script, designed to be easily read without having to memorise complex sentences.

Here’s the prompt:

```
Act as a expert content marketer script writer

Convert this written long form piece into a video script

Write a line by line script. 
Each line should be short and punchy and end with a line break for readability.

Do not include inserts, only text script

[copy/paste long form content]
```
## Prompt Output
![[Pasted image 20240722023001.png]]
This prompt makes every sentence short and sweet. This not only makes it easier for the audience to follow but also makes recording much simpler.

You won’t need to memorise any long sentences - each is designed to be a short punchy sentence.

In the next Part we’ll test out both these script formats and work out which works best for you.
