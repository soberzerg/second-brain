## Never-ending story

First up we need to eliminate writer’s block. Sitting down and thinking “what shall I create” is a thing of the past.

I’m going to give you a prompt that can generate obscene amounts of ideas.

Will they all be good? Nope! You’ll need to select the best and tweak from there. But you’ll have a lot to work from!

This prompt is based of Dickie Bush’s content matrix. I recommend you go and learn anything and everything you can from him by the way. He’s one of the good ones. His blog + newsletter are the place to start.

Here’s the prompt:

```
Act as an expert content strategist and writer.

My audience is [audience details]
Their common problems are [list problems]
My business helps the audience to [how you solve problems]

Help me create a content matrix.
X axis = content types: Actionable How-To, Inspirational Advice, Example Breakdown, Contrarian take, Unique Observation, Present vs. Past, Listicle, Social proof about myself, Lessons learned, Benefits, Reasons Why, Common Mistakes

All relate to the topics in the Y Axis.

The Y axis contains my topics:
Generate a list of topics based on my audience, audience problems and how my business helps.

Generate the full context matrix, giving headlines in each cell. Make sure the content types are on the X axis and my topics in the Y axis.
```

Fill in the specifics of your business. I used the following for this example:

```
My audience is people starting their first business
Their common problems are what niche, no money, no time, stuck in 9-5, not sure first steps.
My business helps the audience to start  a business by leveraging AI tools like chatgpt
```

First the prompt generates a list of Topics:

Then it takes the topics and the content types and creates a huge amount of potential content for us:

This is just a snippet of the whole because there are 10 topics and 12 content types for a total of 120 cells.

That’s 120 things you can talk about right there. No more “I don’t have any ideas”.

Copy/paste these ideas into Excel or Notion or your tool of choice.

We’ll be using them in the next Part to generate posts.

FYI if you use ChatGPT Plus ask it for a CSV file and it’ll give you a downloadable version. Cool huh?

## First Go Long

First up we want to produce a long-form piece of content.

Long-form is basically a blog article, newsletter or short essay. Generally 750+ words.

The reason for this is that we can cascade from long-form to medium and short form easily. We cannot go the other way.

We start with lots of information and break it up into smaller pieces. Large to small. Entropy, baby.

AI is _fantastic_ at the breakdown process of creating lots of smaller content pieces from a large content piece. It’s a powerful use of AI.

This is the linchpin on which this content system is built. And it is why AI is so powerful in content creation.

However, there’s a catch.
## ChatGPT’s Limitations

![[Pasted image 20240722021459.png]]
ChatGPT is **not good** at generating content from scratch.

There, I said it. Sorry AI bros, shoot me.

The content it produces tends to be very generic, very uninspiring and honestly not very enjoyable to read.

Lots of other people will recommend using AI to create newsletters and blog articles.

I do not.

No matter how complex the prompt the results will be uninspiring and inauthentic.

Instead we need to put in human work here at the _top of the funne_l.

We add our human touch here in the long-form content piece and _then_ allow AI to help with breaking it up into shorter form content (in the rest of this Playbook).

We still save a _lot_ of time and energy. But we will need to put some work in here at the beginning of the process.

## Still valuable

Am I going to ask you to write from scratch? If you can - do so.

The higher the quality of the input the higher the quality of the various outputs further down the chain.

But here’s a technique you can embed in your workflow whether you are going to be writing or not.

It’s called **revision prompting**.

Here’s a prompt to get started:

```
Topic = []
Content type = []
Title = []
My audience is [audience details]

Prepare a 1000 word blog article. 
Do not be generic, include non-obvious and controversial takes
Include a strong hook first sentence
```

Input the topic, content type and title from the context matrix in the previous Part.

In this example I use:
![[Pasted image 20240722021759.png]]

This creates a solid blog article. Here’s the beginning:
![[Pasted image 20240722021807.png]]

This blog article is perfectly serviceable but not particularly interesting.

What I recommend doing is using this as a jumping off point.

Have you ever noticed how criticising and editing other people’s work is a lot easier than doing so with your own work?

We can use this fact to our benefit.

Go through the output that ChatGPT has given you and criticise it!

Feed the criticism into ChatGPT.

An example - the generated article above is saying that AI is useful for identifying market trends. The point is fine but not very specific.

So I can feed in a criticism like:

```
Give specific examples and tools. Do not make general sweeping statements.
```

That forces specificity:
![[Pasted image 20240722021815.png]]

Much better. I’d then tell ChatGPT to _add these_ into the main article. You can do this conversationally with a prompt like “these look good. Add them naturally into the 1000 word blog article”

## Revision Prompting

Continue to do this as many times as required.

Read the article, provide a criticism or suggestion, review the revision and ask ChatGPT to combine the revision with the article. Repeat.

Why don’t we build all of these revisions into the original prompt? Why are you being lazy Kyle?

Some people _will_ teach you to add ALL of these specifications into the original prompt. You end up with a 2000 word mega prompt.

_Sometimes_ this works. But in my experience it’ll still produce something generic. It’s genericness built into the mega prompt!

The only way to truly get the output that _you_ as a content creator need is for _you_ to provide revisions. You know what you want and can tell ChatGPT.

Remember that once you have this one high quality long form content piece we’re going to be able to covert it into many many more using AI. It remains a low time commitment considering the value we’ll get.

So use this method of generating a first draft and then providing corrections to get the article to a place where you are happy with it.

## Break it Down
![[Pasted image 20240722021837.png]]

As discussed in the last Part AI is not great at creating content from scratch.

It is however _fantastic_ at breaking content up.

This is called repurposing.

Taking one piece of content and converting it for use in multiple ways.

Specifically we’re going to take our blog article and carve it into lots of short social media posts for X/Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or whatever your platform of choice is.

## Crap in crap out

Important: each time we repurpose using AI the quality will decrease.

If we put crap into then we’ll get crap out.

Therefore we need to start with _as high quality_ content as possible.

This is the reason why in the last Part I suggested you using your brilliant human brain to tweak and finalise the long-form content.

We need that first input content to be as good as possible. Otherwise the AI prompt below will turn bad content into eve worse content!

Before we jump in, I’ve covered repurposing in a lot more detail in its own Playbook. You can get access [_here_](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.zPDlO5DXFqPrjmUTeFq_UoX3wUoeQC7O39PqCx20dQQ) or via the [_Vault_](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FjYWRlbXkuYWlidXNpbmVzc2JyZWFrdGhyb3VnaC5jb20vY2hlY2tvdXQvYWktYnVzaW5lc3MtcGxheWJvb2stdmF1bHQ_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1wcm9tcHRlbnRyZXByZW5ldXIuYmVlaGlpdi5jb20mdXRtX21lZGl1bT1yZWZlcnJhbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249cHJvbXB0LXBsYXlib29rLWJlY29tZS1hLWNvbnRlbnQtbWFya2V0aW5nLW1hY2hpbmUtcGFydC0zIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6IjFkOGFkZTc3LWM1NWItNGNmNy1iYWU0LTk0Yjk1Mzc2MmFlOCIsInB1YmxpY2F0aW9uX2lkIjoiM2Q0MzUwMDgtZGFiMC00OTIwLTgwYzMtNDVjNTMwYTcxNjVhIiwidmlzaXRfdG9rZW4iOiI0YzZlMmE5OS1kYzE5LTQ4MWMtOTI2ZS1hY2QyMjFlN2M2NTgiLCJpYXQiOjE3MDkzOTY0ODksImlzcyI6Im9yY2hpZCJ9.R2QjUqHM0dP0_kVdqRTN3jQgVvqAkighuoPgbg9FVdk).

Right, here’s the prompt we’ll use:

```
Act as a social media content re-purposer

Break the article below this prompt into the specified social media assets 

Posts to create:

1. One post announcing new article on blog. Tease the lede to get the click. 

2. 3x soundbite posts. Find the most intriguing and/or controversial sentences from the article and extract them as soundbites. The soundbites should trigger discussion. Do not reference the article - the post should be self-contained.

3. 3 x Question posts. Analyse the article for intriguing, controversial or fact-collecting questions to ask on social media. The questions should ellicit debate and allow people to express opinions/. Do not reference the article - the post should be self-contained.

4. 3 x expert authority posts. Analyse the article for strong opinions and convert them into expert statements. These should be authoritative and demonstrate thought leadership. Use strong language to make a statement. Do not reference the article - the post should be self-contained.

5. 3 x  inspirational posts. Focus on how the contents of the article could change the readers life. Focus on the fact that they already have what they need in them, they just need to act.  Do not reference the article - the post should be self-contained.

6. 1 x actionable steps post. Analyse the article and extract a set of steps for people to follow. Do not reference the article - the post should be self-contained.


Do not use emojis, do not use hashtags
Dot use overly elevated, salesy language
Each post should be no more than 280 characters
Return results in a tabular format

Article begins:
[copy/paste long form article]
```

For this example I’ve plugged in Part 1 of this guide. This led to this output:
![[Pasted image 20240722022317.png]]

Some of these I’d be happy to post immediately - for example the question posts are good to go.

For others I’d rewrite and work in context. It’s still a lot faster than working from scratch!

As always if there is something about the output that doesn’t work _for you_ then i) tell ChatGPT and ii) adapt the prompt.

Once you’ve done this you’ll be able to easy chunk up any article (created using the method in the last Part) into multiple posts.

Your content production just went up. Waaaay up.

# **X repurposing**

In the last Part we sourced long form content that we were going to repurpose.

In this Part we’ll get chopping and changing to repurpose our target content piece into multiple formats for X.

We’ll be aiming to take 1 content piece to 20+.

## **1. Long form article**

First up on X we’ll do the simplest piece of repurposing.

This is simply bringing the long form piece into X as a long form post. These used to be called Articles. Before that Notes.

The main thing is that they are longer posts than the normal “tweet” length.

Right now X is prioritising long form content on the platform. This will probably change. The algorithm changes a lot!

But right now it’s a golden opportunity. Especially because not that many people are using this format.

Many struggle to write long format content - it doesn’t come as naturally as shorter posts.

Personally this has never been a problem for me! I write too long if anything!

In the last Part we looked at how to create a long form piece if you don’t have a backlog of them. Refer back here if you need to.

For repurposing into a long form X post we can use this prompt:

```
Act as a social media writer

Convert this content piece into a social media post. 

Retain the length and comprehensiveness of the post. 

Focus especially on the first line: the hook. Provide 5 hook examples for me to choose from. Provide these at the top of the output. 

Refine the readability, using line breaks after every 1-2 sentences to make reading flow better.

Make 4 image/graphic suggestions, in-line within the content within []

Do not use hashtags. Do not use emojis. 

Content piece begins:

[Copy/paste content piece]
```

For the content piece I’ve used Step one from the previous Part. Here’s the [_link_](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Byb21wdGVudHJlcHJlbmV1ci5iZWVoaWl2LmNvbS9wL3dyaXR0ZW4tY29udGVudC1yZXB1cnBvc2luZy13aXRoLWFpLXBhcnQtMSIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiI2YjFhMDJmZS0zZGRiLTQyYTUtOWI0Mi1hMjlkOGFlOGI3ZjUiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6IjNkNDM1MDA4LWRhYjAtNDkyMC04MGMzLTQ1YzUzMGE3MTY1YSIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiODhjNGRjMjktOWQ4Ny00ZWM4LWI2MzAtNzljOGU5MmU4ZGQ1IiwiaWF0IjoxNjk4MjA3MjMyLCJpc3MiOiJvcmNoaWQifQ.VhDxO8cDKaCfeEW8mR_7Cb5ykGASOVf04hw1aWuw-ks) as a refresher.

## Prompt Output
![[Pasted image 20240722023514.png]]
Great stuff - it’s been adjusted for readability, making sentences and paragraphs more punchy.

I also asked for image recommendations. If you already have images from your original content obviously you don’t need these! I use Canva to quickly create images.

Make sure to edit to your requirements - don’t just blindly copy paste!

Here’s the final X post itself for reference. Make sure to check this in order to grasp fully the format.

### 2. X Threads

Next let’s make some X Threads.

These are another way of delivering more content than a single post can contain.

Basically because threads are a series of short posts, one after another.

Here’s an example of the first post in a Thread if you are unclear about the format. Click Read 11 replies on this post to see the rest of the Thread:

I’ll be honest. I hate writing Threads. They are fiddly and annoying to structure and input into the X interface. It’s like writing 10 short posts and having to nail each one - pressure!

So I created this prompt to take long form content and slice and dice it into bitesized chunks.
Here’s the prompt:

```
Act as a social media writer

Convert this content piece into a series of short tweets.

Each can be no longer than 280 characters. Aim for shorter.
Aim for 10 tweets max.

Each tweet should be short, sharp. One idea, example or action per tweet. Aim for one tweet to flow to the next. 
 
Retain the length and comprehensiveness of the post. 

Focus especially on the first tweet: the hook. Provide 5 hook examples for me to choose from. In the first tweet indicate that this is a thread and give reason to continue reading.

Do not use hashtags. Do not use emojis except in hook.

Do not include "" around posts. Provide in an easy copy/paste format. 

Content piece begins:
[copy/paste content piece]
```

## Prompt Output
![[Pasted image 20240722023545.png]]
And here’s the actual thread:

You’ll notice I kept the main body of each post but in some cases added a little more or adjusted the structure. Make sure to do this - use the generated version as a jumping off point as always!

## **3. Individual Posts**

The final format we’ll look at for X are short form single posts.

This is your bread and butter on X.

```
Act as a social media writer

Convert this content piece into individual tweets. 

Each tweet should be short, sharp. One idea, example, action or question per tweet.  

Generate the following:
5 questions to spark conversation
5 motivational tweets
5 mistakes I've made tweets
5 authority statements

Do not use hashtags. Do not use emojis except in hook.

Do not include "" around posts. Provide in an easy copy/paste format. 

Content piece begins:
[copy/paste content piece]
```

## Prompt Output
![[Pasted image 20240722023601.png]]
These are some great starter posts. Filter the ones you like and rewrite them in your tone of voice.

The power of these shorter posts is you can “theme” a day or week.

For example all my long form posts, threads and individual tweets can be about repurposing. It creates thematic consistency.

Another tip here - got a particular creator whose style you love? Copy paste 10 of their top tweets into ChatGPT and say “in the style of these” in order to emulate. Of course make sure to give your own spin. Don’t be lazy!
