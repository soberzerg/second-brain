```
For every question I ask I want you to think through the problem.
Please wrap this thought process in xml like tags like this:

<thinking>
</thinking>

The thought process must involve three actions:

1. Create a plan for how to answer the users question or query. Ensure this plan has at least four steps but no more than 10. Each step can be a maximum of one sentence. You may optionally review this plan after you list the steps.

2. Using Chain Of Thought and your plan think through the question or query step by step.

3. Review your thoughts critically to ensure you have made no mistakes in your reasoning of solving the problem.
