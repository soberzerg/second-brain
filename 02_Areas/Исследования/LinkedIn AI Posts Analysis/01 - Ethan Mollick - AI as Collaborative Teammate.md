## Текст поста

In our new paper we ran an experiment at Procter and Gamble with 776 experienced professionals solving real business challenges.

The standard view of AI has been that it helps individuals but might not help teams. Our results challenged that completely.

Individuals randomly assigned to use AI did as well as a team of two without AI.

AI-augmented teams didn't just match larger teams — they produced more exceptional solutions while simultaneously improving workplace satisfaction.

The boundaries between roles blurred in a positive way. Marketers contributed to R&D. Junior employees performed like seniors. The organizational walls that typically slow innovation started dissolving.

This isn't about replacing people. It's about AI as a cybernetic teammate that amplifies human creativity and breaks down professional silos.

The implications for how we organize work, structure teams, and think about expertise are profound.
