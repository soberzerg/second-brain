## Текст поста (реконструкция из нескольких источников)

GenAI is easy to start but hard to scale.

Too many companies are stuck in endless pilots that never reach production.

McKinsey studied 150+ GenAI initiatives across enterprises and surfaced one key pattern.

The ones that scale don't just build tools. They build the system around them.

More specifically, they build:

→ A self-service portal — So teams can easily access pre-approved models, tools, and documentation

→ An open architecture — To enable reuse, plug in best-in-class components, and avoid vendor lock-in

→ Built-in governance guardrails — To enforce policy, catch hallucinations, and manage cost automatically

→ A centralized AI gateway — To route prompts, track usage, and maintain control across teams

Why does this matter?

Because most GenAI programs aren't failing due to model performance. They're struggling with something quieter, but deeper:

1. Innovation stalls
- Teams spend 30-50% of their "innovation time" on compliance, duplicate work, or low-impact projects.
- Momentum fades before real value is unlocked.

2. Scaling breaks down
- Even great ideas stay stuck in pilot.
- Risk and governance concerns stop them from reaching production.

You don't scale GenAI by scaling apps, but by scaling the platform that lets teams build, govern, and evolve at speed.

McKinsey's advice: Build a central GenAI platform — not just tools, but a system of reusable services, open architecture, and automated guardrails.

It's not fast to build. But they've seen results like:
→ 6-week setup cycles reduced to 1-day sandboxes
→ App approval processes cut by 90%

For orgs serious about GenAI, the shift isn't just technical, it's architectural. And it's becoming the difference between one-off pilots and real, durable impact.
