## 1. Niche Navigator

```
Act as a business coach

My skills are: [skills]

Generate a list of business niches that combine some or all of these skills. Note the skills next to the niche.

For context I am a solopreneur or small business entrant. Assume no or low capital, small team and reliance on bootstrapping.

For each niche find the market sizing

For each niche perform a market competition analysis - provide a x/100 index for competition
```

This prompt will help you to narrow down your first business niche idea.

Don’t stress this process _too_ much - there’s no need to come up with the perfect business niche right out of the gate.

Instead use the prompt to hone in on something that you can work with over the course of the next 9 days. This is a process and once you’ve run through the process once it becomes much simpler (and faster) to do again. And again. And again!

Believe me, as an entrepreneur you’ll have a LOT of business ideas. Don’t be precious about them but instead work on validating whether they are worth pursuing ASAP.

This is such a difficult step for so many aspiring entrepreneurs that I created the **🧭 AI Niche Navigator** to help which you can get free in the [AI Business Breakthrough Academy.](https://aibusinessbreakthrough.com/join/)

```
Act as a business competitor analyst

First, assess the above business and provide a list of competitors in the niche

Second, for each competitors scan their website, information to complete the following table: name, website, unique positioning, strengths, weaknesses

Third, based on the table provide 3 potential positioning strategy for my business to carve a space in the market
```

## 2. Business Strategist

```
Act as a business strategist

Prepare a business plan for the following business niche idea:

[copy/paste niche idea details]

Prepare a plan that follows these guidelines:

The business follows the BATON system of Business (niche), Audience, Tribe, Offer, Network.

Business = defining the value generated, the customer definition, the product-market fit, defining the customer’s primary problem.

Audience = getting the value of the business out to the ideal customers, content marketing based around the customer’s primary problem, wide attention grabbing content on social media (preference Twitter)

Tribe = capturing customer details (email) via lead magnet and email newsletter, building rapport and trust

Offer = after audience growth and tribe trust build the offer is made, sales funnel from low cost tripwire digital product ($) to core digital product ($$) to service offering ($$$) all addressing the same customer problem but moving from DIY to done for you.

Network = scaling the business by adding more customers and / or selling more products and services to the same customer pool.
```

This prompt will take the chosen business niche and formulate a business plan for you.

It’s based of the BATON framework that I teach.

**Business** - what is the value your business creates?

**Audience**- how will you let the world know about this value?

**Tribe** - how will people raise their hand and tell you they want to know more?

**Offer** - how will you package up and sell the value?

**Network** - how will you scale up?

**I’ve attached a PDF** with more details on the framework if you want more details.

Alternatively let the prompt to the heavy lifting! The framework is built in.

## 3. Competitive Analysis

Here’s the prompt:

```
Act as a business competitor analyst

First, assess the above business and provide a list of competitors in the niche

Second, for each competitors scan their website, information to complete the following table: name, website, unique positioning, strengths, weaknesses

Third, based on the table provide 3 potential positioning strategy for my business to carve a space in the market
```

As an entrepreneur you need to learn to love competition.

Sounds weird right?

But competition in a market means that a market exists!

If there’s no competition then, chances are, there’s no market. People have tried and failed to build sustainable businesses.

If there are existing companies (competitors) in a market then customers, revenue and profits exist. Otherwise the competitors would have ceased to exist!

Sounds paradoxical right? But grasping this separates the amateurs from the pros.

Competition risk is better than market risk!

Competitors we can outmanoeuvre. A non-existent market we cannot.

## 4. Sales funnel

```
Act as a sales and marketing expert

My business idea is [copy/paste business idea]

My positioning strategy is [copy/paste strategy]

My customer’s main problem is [customer problem]

Plan a sales funnel following this structure:

- Lead magnet, free for email capture
- Low cost tripwire offer to liquidate costs
- Core offer, digital product, low start up time/cost required
- Upsell offer, continuity offer
- Premium offer, service

For each element generate 5 potentials
```

Sales funnels are a _relatively_ new concept in digital marketing - within the last decade or so.

Before we used to just blast web traffic at a sales page and hope for the best!

It’s more sophisticated now, thanks in large part to a guy called Russell Brunson. Here is one of his (many) helpful graphics to show how a sales funnel works.

![[Sales Funnel.png]]

I’d recommend checking out his work as a great way to level up your digital marketing. He has a series of “Secrets” books, starting with DotCom Secrets. Definitely worth picking a copy up.

For your first funnel we’ll use the prompt above. It’ll help you come up with potentials for each stage of the funnel to chose from.

Focus on the early parts of the funnel as the priority. Why? Because if no-one gets through the first steps then the latter steps don’t matter!

We’ll be building out the lead magnet and other early components in the rest of this course.

In the spirit of openness here’s a quick bonus video revealing my whole funnel!

This is to show you that I’m not teaching you one thing and doing another.

Instead it gives you a live example of exactly what a BATON based funnel looks like.

**My full funnel:**

1. Twitter (Audience) ([https://twitter.com/iamkylebalmer](https://twitter.com/iamkylebalmer))
2. Newsletter (Tribe) ([https://promptentrepreneur.beehiiv.com/](https://promptentrepreneur.beehiiv.com/))
3. This course! (High Value Tripwire offer)
4. Prompt Playbooks (Super High Value Tripwire offer) (Example: [https://kdgbalmer.gumroad.com/l/start](https://kdgbalmer.gumroad.com/l/start))
5. Niche Navigator (Core #1) ([https://aibusinessbreakthrough.com/niche/](https://aibusinessbreakthrough.com/niche/))
6. AI Business Breakthrough Academy (Core #2) ([https://aibusinessbreakthrough.com/join](https://aibusinessbreakthrough.com/join))
7. Premium Service: Consulting ([https://topmate.io/kylebalmer](https://topmate.io/kylebalmer) + custom)

Once you know this basic funnel you’ll start to see it all over the internet! Your eyes will be open to this basic funnel pattern.

It’s a bit like when you buy a new red BMW. And then _all you see_ are other red BMWs! Once we’re correctly primed it’s easy to see patterns.

## 5. Content Plan

Here’s the prompt:

```
Act as a content marketing expert

Generate a content plan for my business

My business idea is [copy/paste business idea]

The goal is to use content to build an Audience which can then be converted into a Tribe by capturing their email contact details

The journey is from Unknown > Content Viewer > Follower > Email Captured > Prospect > Customer

Content should start surface level, viral and move towards in-depth, expert driven. Trust should be built along the route.

My customer’s primary problem is :  [customer problem]

Generate 3 content pillars for me to focus on

Then suggest content types for Unknown, Viewer, Follower for each of the 3 pillars

My primary platform will be Twitter. Focus on short, medium and longer threads on Twitter.
```

This prompt helps up begin the A of BATON: Audience.

It’ll generate a basic content marketing plan specific to our business niche and, importantly, customer problem.

Make sure to copy in the customer problem - this will be the core of your Audience content strategy, answering their questions and solving their problems.

This prompt (and later prompts) focus on Twitter/X.

The reason for this is that it’s the simplest place to grow based on your content only, without spending money to advertise.

It also doesn’t require more complex content production methods like imagery (Instagram) or video (TikTok and YouTube).

However, if you know that your audience is _only_ on a different platform obviously that’s where we need to go! For instance they may be on LinkedIn - if this is the case adjust the prompt accordingly.

## 6. Brand

Here’s the prompt:

```
Act as a brand expert

Design brand assets for my business

The business is [business idea]

My position is [positioning strategy]

Generated suggested fonts, give rationale

Generate suggested colour palette, give rationale

Create the following assets, applying the above brand guidelines:

Brand tagline (5 alternatives)
Brand values
Brand mission
Brief for logo
Brief for twitter header
Brief for Linkedin header
```

This prompt will generate text briefs, not the actual designs themselves.

To convert the brief into a graphic simply say “create the logo” or “create the twitter header”.

This will take the text brief generated by the first prompt and send it to DALLE (within ChatGPT) to create the actual graphic.

You may need to use [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) to make adjustments. It’s a free tool and well worth adding to your creative arsenal.

As with all steps don’t get hung up here - create graphic assets that are enough to get rolling with and then when you are up and running you can loop back to refine!

Perfection is the enemy of progress. Progress _first_ and then worry about it being perfect!

## 7. Lead Magnet

Here’s the prompt:

```
Act as a social media manager for Twitter

Use the provided content plan to produce tweets for the content pillar [number]

Provide 10 short, 5 medium posts in full. And 5 long post ideas.
Do not use hashtags or emojis.

Short tweets should be 1-2 sentences, impactful, thought provoking, controversial, challenging.

Medium tweets should use the full 180 characters and show specific domain expertise, avoiding platitudes, ask a questions to begin discussion.

Long tweets should be a thread format (multiple individual tweets) chained together. Provide ideas.
```

```
Act as a social media manager for Instagram

Use the provided content plan to produce reels for the content pillar [number]

Provide 10 reel ideas.
```

This prompt takes your content marketing plan from the last lesson and converts it into actual content.

Remember to add the content pillar number in line 2.

If you try to do _all_ the pillars you’ll get a output but the quality will tend to be lower as ChatGPT will be trying to fit too much into the output.

You can rerun this prompt as often as required to generate more content. This is also a great chance to work on refining a prompt - basically as you use a prompt multiple times it can be helpful to adjust it so that your outcomes are better.

For example perhaps you notice the prompt keeps giving you overly formal outputs. You could adjust the prompt by adding a line like “Make it humorous” to test if the results are better.

If you like them more you can then leave that extra line in the prompt when you use it in the future.

This process of adjusting and improving prompts if called prompt engineering. This reusable Twitter content prompt is a great chance to practice!
