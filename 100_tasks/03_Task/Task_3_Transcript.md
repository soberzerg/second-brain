# Task 3: Validate Your Problem

> Task 3 is our final step in carving out a problem worth solving!

## Overview

The process of validating your chosen problems can be done in a **three-part act**.

Start by taking your highest ranked problem from the previous task and proceed by defining the **consumer archetype** affected by this issue.

Envision this character out in the real world - *Who is this person and how exactly is he affected?*

## Extracting Feedback

Once the archetype is defined, the question then becomes **how best to extract feedback** from this particular persona. This is a process with many parts to it, but one that starts with the question of *How?*

### Methods to Reach Stakeholders

Think about if you'll use a survey. Or perhaps you'll utilize interviews? It is critical here to weigh out the effectiveness between the two:

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Surveys** | Fast, provide consistency | Won't let you dig deeper into the problem |
| **Interviews** | Personal, space to deep-dive | Limited scope due to time intensiveness |

**Determine the trade-off.**

## Case Study: Gorillas

Gorillas became the fastest startup to reach unicorn status in Europe and their success can be traced back to the very early stages where we find ourselves now.

1. They curated a **feedback loop** that was driven by the needs of a carefully defined archetype
2. They gathered this feedback with a **tool that was perfectly suited** to their chosen persona
3. In doing so, they **validated the problem** they were set out to solve from the very get-go

Everything they built afterwards therefore remained in line with solving this issue.

## Key Insight: The Thesis Analogy

Think back to your early days in the classroom when learning how to write a great essay.

A fundamental rule of thumb is that each of your paragraphs must eventually tie back to your original thesis.

**In the case of a successful startup, everything - the business model, vision, operations, roadmap - must also tie back to your original thesis: aka The Problem!**
