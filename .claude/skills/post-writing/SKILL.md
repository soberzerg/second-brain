# Post Writing Skill

## When to use this skill

- User asks to write a post for LinkedIn, Telegram, or Blog.
- User wants to rewrite a text to be more engaging or "viral".
- User mentions specific copywriting techniques (hooks, slippery slide, etc.).

## Workflow

1.  **Analyze & Clarify**:
    - Identify the **Goal** (sales, engagement, education, brand awareness).
    - Identify the **Target Audience** (Unaware, Problem-Aware, Solution-Aware, etc.).
    - Identify the **Key Takeaway** (What should the reader do/think after?).
    - _If any of these are missing, ASK the user first._

2.  **Select a Hook**:
    - Review `resources/hooks-guide.md` to refresh on hook types.
    - Propose **3 distinct hook options** to the user (e.g., one Story, one Problem, one Proclamation).
    - Ask the user to choose one.

3.  **Draft the Post**:
    - Once the hook is chosen, write the full draft.
    - **Tone**: Pragmatic, Honest (Build in Public), Creative. Use `resources/style-guide.md` for specific voice, emoji usage, and formatting nuances.
    - **Structure**:
      - **Hook** (The chosen one).
      - **The Slippery Slide**: Short sentences, open loops, connecting logic.
      - **Body**: Deliver value/content.
      - **Conclusion/CTA**: Clear next step or thought-provoking ending.
    - **Formatting**: Use bolding for emphasis, bullet points for lists, and keep paragraphs short.

4.  **Review**:
    - Check against the "Slippery Slide" rule: Does every sentence lead to the next?
    - Check "so what?": Is the value clear?
    - Check "fluff": Remove generic words ("revolutionary", "innovative", "landscape").

## Instructions

### Core Principles

- **David Ogilvy**: "The headline is 80 cents of your dollar." Spend time on the hook.
- **Joseph Sugarman**: "The sole purpose of the first sentence is to get you to read the second sentence."
- **Eugene Schwartz**: "Talk to the conversation already going on in the prospect's mind." (Match the awareness level).

### Step-by-Step Execution

#### Step 1: Context Gathering

If the user provides a topic (e.g., "Write about AI agents"), do NOT just write. Ask:

> "To make this impactful, I need to know:
>
> 1. Who is this for? (Engineers, Founders, Investors?)
> 2. What is the one thing they should remember?
> 3. Do you have a specific story or data point to include?"

#### Step 2: Hook Generation

Generate 3 variations following the Great Leads framework.
_Example output:_

> "Here are 3 hook options regarding [Topic]:
>
> 1. **Story Lead**: 'I spent 3 days debugging this error. The solution took 5 minutes.'
> 2. **Proclamation Lead**: 'Most developers are using AI agents wrong.'
> 3. **Promise Lead**: 'How to cut your debugging time by 50% using this specific agent workflow.'
>    Which one resonates most with the angle you want to take?"

#### Step 3: Drafting

- **Don't be boring.** Avoid "In this post I will talk about...".
- **Be specific.** Instead of "We improved performance", say "We reduced latency from 500ms to 50ms".
- **Use "You" and "I".** Make it personal.

#### Step 4: Refinement

- **Read it aloud.** If you stumble, rewrite.
- **Visuals.** Suggest where an image or screenshot would fit (e.g., `[Insert screenshot of the error log here]`).
