# X (Twitter) Guide for AISobolev — English Content

## Platform Overview

- **Limit:** 280 characters per tweet, threads for long-form
- **Language:** English
- **Role in strategy:** International audience, bootstrapper community, building authority in EN space
- **Voice:** "Builder thinking out loud" — same as Russian content, but more concise and direct

---

## Formatting Rules

- **280 characters max** per single tweet — every word must earn its place
- **Threads:** hook tweet → 3-7 value tweets → summary/CTA tweet
- **No markdown** — plain text only (bold/italic don't work)
- **Images/screenshots** boost engagement significantly
- **Quote tweets** > retweets (add your take, don't just share)
- **Line breaks** matter — use them to create visual rhythm

---

## Voice in English

The same "builder thinking out loud" voice, translated to English:

**Do:**
- Direct, punchy sentences
- First person ("I", "my", "we")
- Specific numbers ("$2000 MRR" not "good revenue")
- Contrarian takes backed by experience
- Show the work, not just the result

**Don't:**
- Formal business English ("I would like to share...")
- Motivational fluff ("Believe in yourself!")
- Translate Russian posts word-for-word (rewrite, don't translate)
- Use buzzwords without substance ("leverage synergies")

## Post Types

### 1. Single Tweet — Hot Take

One bold statement. Under 280 chars. Provocative but honest.

**Examples:**
```
You don't need a co-founder for your first business.

You need discipline and one paying client.
```

```
The best marketing for a bootstrapped startup is cold DMs.

Not ads. Not SEO. Not content.

47 messages. 3 clients. $0 spent.
```

```
Stop building. Start selling.

Your MVP is a Google Doc and a Stripe link.
```

### 2. Single Tweet — Data Point

One specific number from your experience. Concrete and shareable.

**Examples:**
```
6 months of bootstrapping:

→ $0 invested
→ 3 products running
→ $2000/mo revenue
→ 0 employees (just me + AI)

No investors. No co-founder. No office.
```

```
Sent 100 cold DMs this month.

12 replied.
5 got on a call.
3 became clients.

Total ad spend: $0.
```

### 3. Single Tweet — Question

Engaging question that invites replies.

**Examples:**
```
Founders who bootstrapped to $10k/mo:

What was the single most important decision you made?
```

```
Hot take: Most solo founders fail not because of bad products, but because they never learn to sell.

Agree or disagree?
```

### 4. Thread — Deep Dive

Hook tweet → value delivery → CTA.

**Example:**

```
Tweet 1 (hook):
I built 3 businesses with $0 investment in 6 months.

No investors. No savings. No connections.

Here's exactly what I did (thread) 🧵

Tweet 2:
Business #1: Consulting.
I took what I already knew (Go/Python dev) and offered it as a service.
First client came from a cold DM on Telegram.

Tweet 3:
Business #2: AI Agency.
I packaged my consulting into a productized service.
Same skills, but now with a clear offer and price.

Tweet 4:
Business #3: SaaS product.
Built it solo, using consulting revenue to fund my time.
No external money needed.

Tweet 5:
The key insight: consulting → agency → product.
Each step funded the next.
Don't skip straight to SaaS.

Tweet 6:
The tools that made this possible:
→ Claude Code for development
→ Obsidian for knowledge management
→ AI assistant for operations

One person doing the work of five.

Tweet 7 (CTA):
If you're thinking about starting your first business:
Start with what you already know.
Sell before you build.
Let clients fund your product.

Follow for more bootstrapping stories from the trenches.
```

## Thread Structure Formula

```
Tweet 1: [Hook — bold claim or surprising data] + "Thread 🧵"
Tweet 2-N: [One point per tweet, each tweet standalone readable]
Final tweet: [Summary + follow CTA]
```

**Rules:**
- Every tweet should be readable standalone (someone might see just one in their feed)
- Use → arrows for lists within tweets
- Number your points if it's a list thread ("1/", "2/", etc.)
- Keep each tweet under 250 chars for better readability
- Add a relevant image/screenshot to tweet 1 when possible

---

## Engagement Tactics

- **Quote tweets** — add your take to others' content (builds connections)
- **Reply to bigger accounts** — thoughtful replies get noticed
- **Post consistently** — 3-5 tweets/day, 1-2 threads/week
- **Best times:** 9am, 12pm, 5pm EST (US audience)
- **Pin your best thread** — it's your landing page
- **Use "Follow for more"** in thread CTAs — it works

---

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ **Word-for-word translation** from Russian — rewrite for EN audience
- ❌ **Too formal** — "I would like to share my professional experience" sounds corporate
- ❌ **Thread without a hook** — if tweet 1 doesn't grab, nobody reads tweet 2
- ❌ **Only self-promotion** — give value first, sell later
- ❌ **Ignore replies** — engagement is a two-way street
- ❌ **Too many hashtags** — on X, 0-2 hashtags max (unlike Threads)

## Thread Checklist

- [ ] **Hook in tweet 1?** (would YOU click "show more"?)
- [ ] **Each tweet standalone?** (readable without context)
- [ ] **Under 250 chars per tweet?** (leaves room for engagement)
- [ ] **Specific numbers?** (not "a lot" but "$2000")
- [ ] **Thread delivers on hook's promise?** (no bait-and-switch)
- [ ] **CTA in final tweet?** (follow, reply, bookmark)
- [ ] **Sounds like a person?** (not a marketing bot)
- [ ] **Would you bookmark this?** (the ultimate quality test)
