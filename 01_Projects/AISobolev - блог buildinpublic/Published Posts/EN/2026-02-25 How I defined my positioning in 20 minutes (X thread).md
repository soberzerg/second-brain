# How I defined my positioning in 20 minutes (X thread)

Tweet 1 (hook):
Defining your positioning usually takes a week with a marketing consultant.

Mine took 20 minutes.

Here's how a "second brain" + AI changed the game: 🧵

Tweet 2:
The usual process:

Someone asks "what do you do?"
You freeze.
You stare at the ceiling.
You squeeze out "I help businesses with AI."

Sounds like everyone else.

Tweet 3:
What I did differently:

I built a personal knowledge base. All my projects. Clients. Case studies. Decisions. Numbers.

Not a notes app. A system AI can actually read.

Tweet 4:
When I loaded a positioning prompt, AI didn't start from zero.

It already knew:
→ 20 years in software dev
→ ~100 IT projects
→ My active clients and their results
→ Specific problems I've solved

Tweet 5:
So instead of "tell me about your experience," it asked:

"What situations do clients come to you with?"
"What do they thank you for? Specifically."
"What do you do that others don't?"

Questions a $1000 consultant would ask. But sharper.

Tweet 6:
20 minutes later I had:

→ 3 positioning variations
→ Client portrait based on real situations
→ 5 core problems I solve
→ My "secret sauce" (things I thought were obvious)
→ 3 one-sentence offers
→ 12 content talking points

Tweet 7:
The key insight:

AI without your context = generic fluff.
AI with your context = precise answers in your own words.

Same tool. Completely different output.

Tweet 8 (CTA):
The difference between "I played with ChatGPT" and "AI works for my business" is one thing:

Context.

Building my second brain was the highest-ROI thing I did this year.
